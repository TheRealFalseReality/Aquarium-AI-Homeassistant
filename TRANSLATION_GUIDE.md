- `fr` - French (Fran√ßais)
- `it` - Italian (Italiano)

- And many more...

For a complete list, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

### 2. Create Your Translation File

1. Navigate to `custom_components/aquarium_ai/translations/`
2. Copy the `template.json` file or `en.json` file
3. Rename it to `[language_code].json` (e.g., `es.json` for Spanish)

### 3. Translate the Content

Open your new language file and translate all the text values while keeping the structure intact:

#### Important Rules:

- **DO NOT** change the JSON structure or key names
- **DO NOT** translate the keys (left side of the colon)
- **ONLY** translate the values (right side of the colon, inside quotes)
- Keep technical terms like "AI", "pH", "Home Assistant" as they are
- Maintain formatting like line breaks (`\n`) if present
- Keep placeholders exactly as they are (e.g., `%s`, `{value}`)

#### Example:

**English (en.json):**
```json
{
  "config": {
    "step": {
      "user": {
        "title": "Aquarium AI Setup",
        "data": {
          "tank_name": "Aquarium Name"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Spanish (es.json):**
```json
{
  "config": {
    "step": {
      "user": {
        "title": "Configuraci√≥n de Aquarium AI",
        "data": {
          "tank_name": "Nombre del Acuario"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. What to Translate

The translation file contains the following sections:

#### Configuration Flow Strings
- **title**: Dialog titles
- **description**: Dialog descriptions
- **data**: Field labels
- **data_description**: Field help text

#### Error Messages
- Error messages shown when configuration fails

#### Options Flow Strings
- Similar to configuration flow, but for modifying existing setups

#### Service Strings
- Service names and descriptions

### 5. Testing Your Translation

After creating your translation file:

1. Copy the file to your Home Assistant's `custom_components/aquarium_ai/translations/` directory
2. Change your Home Assistant user profile language to match your translation
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration ‚Üí Aquarium AI
4. Verify that all text appears correctly in your language

### 6. Submit Your Translation

Once you've completed and tested your translation:

1. Fork this repository on GitHub
2. Add your translation file to `custom_components/aquarium_ai/translations/`
3. Update this guide to list your language in the "Available Languages" section
4. Create a Pull Request with a clear title like "Add Spanish translation"
5. In the PR description, mention:
   - The language you translated
   - That you've tested the translation
   - Any special considerations for your language

## Translation Tips

### Special Terms

Some terms should remain consistent:

- **AI** - Usually kept as "AI" in most languages
- **pH** - Always "pH" (not "PH" or "ph")
- **Home Assistant** - Brand name, keep as is
- **Sensor** - Translate to your language's equivalent
- **Camera** - Translate to your language's equivalent

### Aquarium-Specific Terms

Common aquarium terms to be aware of:
- **Salinity** - Salt concentration in water
- **Dissolved Oxygen** - Amount of oxygen dissolved in water
- **ORP** - Oxidation-Reduction Potential (sometimes kept as ORP in translations)
- **Specific Gravity (SG)** - Density measurement for saltwater
- **ppt/psu** - Parts per thousand / Practical Salinity Unit

### Formal vs. Informal

Consider the tone appropriate for your language:
- Home Assistant typically uses a friendly, professional tone
- Most languages use formal "you" (e.g., "Sie" in German, "usted" in Spanish)
- But some communities prefer informal tone - use your best judgment

### Regional Variations

If your language has significant regional differences:
- Use the most widely understood variant
- Avoid region-specific slang or idioms
- Consider creating separate files for major variants (e.g., `pt-BR` for Brazilian Portuguese, `pt` for European Portuguese)

## Translation Checklist

Before submitting your translation, verify:

- [ ] All strings are translated (no English text remaining)
- [ ] JSON syntax is valid (use a JSON validator if needed)
