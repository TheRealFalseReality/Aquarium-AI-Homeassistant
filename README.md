# Aquarium AI for Home Assistant

![Aquarium AI](logo.png)

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

**Aquarium AI** is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that uses the power of AI to analyze the conditions of your aquarium. It dynamically evaluates your existing sensors and camera feeds, providing clear text-based analyses of both quantitative sensor data and qualitative visual observations.

This integration takes the guesswork out of maintaining a healthy aquatic environment by turning raw sensor data and visual monitoring into actionable insights.

## Features

* **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages the built-in `ai_task` service to generate natural language analyses of your aquarium's conditions.
* **Dynamic Entity Creation**: Automatically creates text sensors for each AI analysis point (e.g., temperature, pH, overall health) based on the sensors you provide.
* **Camera Visual Analysis**: Optional camera integration for AI-powered visual monitoring of water clarity, fish health, plant condition, and maintenance needs.
* **UI Configuration**: Simple setup process through the Home Assistant UI. No YAML configuration is required.
* **Customizable Polling**: Choose how often the AI analysis should run, from every hour to once a day.
* **On-Demand Updates**: Trigger an analysis at any time using a service call, perfect for automations and custom schedules.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Important Notice Regarding Home Assistant AI Tasks feature*:  
> **You must have a generative LLM AI installed in you Home Assistant via integrations (see link below), this typially creates an `ai_task.YOUR_PROVIDER` for this integration to use.**
>
Before you can install and use Aquarium AI, you must have the following set up:  

1. A working **Home Assistant** instance (Version 2025.1.0+).
2. **HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)** installed.  
3. The core **`ai_task`** integration must be enabled and configured in Home Assistant. This integration will not work without it. [**AI Task Documentation**](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ai_task)
4. One or more **aquarium-related sensors** (e.g., temperature, pH, salinity, etc.) available in Home Assistant.
5. Optionally, one or more **camera entities** for visual monitoring of your aquarium.

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the **HACS** section in your Home Assistant.
2. Click on **Integrations**, then click the three-dots menu in the top-right and select **"Custom repositories"**.
3. Add the URL to this GitHub repository in the "Repository" field.
4. Select **"Integration"** for the category and click **"Add"**.
5. The "Aquarium AI" integration will now appear in your HACS list. Click on it and then click **"Download"**.
6. Restart Home Assistant when prompted.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/TheRealFalseReality/Aquarium-AI-Homeassistant/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Copy the `aquarium_ai` folder (from within the `custom_components` directory) into your Home Assistant's `config/custom_components/` directory.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Once installed, the integration must be configured through the UI.

1. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**.
2. Click the **"+ Add Integration"** button in the bottom right.
3. Search for **"Aquarium AI"** and click on it.
4. A configuration dialog will appear. You will be asked to provide:
   * **Aquarium Name**: A custom name for your tank (e.g., "Main Tank", "Reef Setup").
   * **Aquarium Type**: Select the type of your aquarium (e.g., Marine, Freshwater, Reef).
   * **AI Task**: Choose the AI task entity to use for analysis (e.g., ai_task.google_ai_task).
   * **Update Frequency**: Choose how often you want the analysis to run automatically.
   * **Auto-send Notifications**: Enable or disable automatic notifications.
   * **Sensors**: Select the sensor entities you wish for the AI to analyze (temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water level).
   * **Camera** (Optional): Select a camera entity for visual analysis of water quality, fish health, and maintenance needs.
5. Click **"Submit"**. The integration will set up all the necessary entities.

## Usage & Entities

After configuration, the integration will create a new "Aquarium AI" device with several entities associated with it.

### AI Analysis Sensors

These `sensor` entities contain AI-generated text analysis limited to 1-2 sentences (under 255 characters):

* `sensor.[tank_name]_[sensor_name]_analysis`: AI analysis of each specific parameter (e.g., Temperature Analysis, pH Analysis).
* `sensor.[tank_name]_overall_analysis`: Comprehensive AI summary of the aquarium's overall health.

### Status Sensors

These `sensor` entities provide quick status information:

* `sensor.[tank_name]_simple_status`: Overall status message with emoji (e.g., "Your Marine Aquarium is Excellent! ðŸŒŸ").
* `sensor.[tank_name]_quick_status`: One or two-word status (e.g., "Excellent", "Good", "Needs Attention").
* `sensor.[tank_name]_[sensor_name]_status`: Status for each parameter with current value (e.g., "Good (24.5Â°C)").

### Notification System

The integration also sends periodic notifications (if enabled) with detailed analysis including:

* Overall status summary
* Current sensor readings with icons
* Detailed AI analysis for each parameter
* Visual observations from camera (if configured)
* Recommendations when needed

#### Example Notifications

## Camera Visual Analysis

When a camera is configured, the AI will analyze images from your aquarium camera to provide additional insights:

### Visual Monitoring Capabilities

* **Water Quality Assessment**: Analyzes water clarity, color, and cloudiness without numerical measurements
* **Fish Health & Behavior**: Identifies fish species, counts visible fish, and observes behavioral patterns
* **Plant Health**: Monitors aquatic plant condition and growth patterns
* **Equipment Monitoring**: Checks visibility and apparent condition of equipment
* **Maintenance Alerts**: Identifies visible algae, debris, or cleanliness issues

### Integration with Sensor Data

Visual analysis complements sensor readings by providing context that numbers alone cannot capture. The AI combines both quantitative sensor data and qualitative visual observations to give you a complete picture of your aquarium's health.

**Note**: Camera analysis focuses on observable qualities rather than precise measurements, providing insights that enhance rather than replace your sensor monitoring.

---

## Advanced Usage: Service Call

The integration adds a service that allows you to trigger analysis updates manually. This is useful for creating automations based on specific events (e.g., after a water change).

**Service:** `aquarium_ai.run_analysis`

This service will:

* Update all AI analysis sensors with fresh analysis
* Update all status sensors with current readings  
* Send a notification (if notifications are enabled)

### Example Automation

This automation runs an analysis every day at 8:00 AM, overriding the schedule you chose in the config.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Run Aquarium AI Analysis Daily at 8 AM"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "08:00:00"
    action:
      - service: aquarium_ai.run_analysis
```

### A Note on Development (Vibe Coding Disclaimer)

This integration is a passion project developed with a "just build it" philosophy. It's built iteratively as ideas and inspiration strike. While every effort is made to ensure it's stable and reliable, you might encounter unexpected quirks. Community feedback is a huge part of this process, so please don't hesitate to open an issue if you find a bug or have a great idea!
