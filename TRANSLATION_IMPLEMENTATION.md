# Translation Implementation Summary

This document describes the translation support implementation for Aquarium AI.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Translation Directory Structure

Created a `translations/` directory in the integration following Home Assistant's standard:

```
custom_components/aquarium_ai/
├── strings.json              # Default/fallback English strings
└── translations/             # Language-specific translations
    ├── en.json              # English translation
    ├── de.json              # German translation
    └── template.json        # Template for new translations
```

### 2. Translation Files

- **strings.json**: Retained as the default fallback (Home Assistant standard)
- **translations/en.json**: English translation (copy of strings.json)
- **translations/de.json**: German translation with all strings translated
- **translations/template.json**: Template file for contributors

### 3. How It Works

Home Assistant automatically:
1. Detects the user's language preference from their profile
2. Looks for matching translation file in `translations/` directory
3. Falls back to `strings.json` if no translation is found
4. Uses English (en) as ultimate fallback

No code changes were required - Home Assistant handles this automatically!

### 4. What Gets Translated

All user-facing strings in the integration:

#### Configuration Flow
- Dialog titles and descriptions
- Field labels and help text
- Error messages

#### Options Flow
- Settings dialog content
- Field descriptions
- Validation errors

#### Services
- Service names and descriptions

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for contributors:

- **TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step guide for translating
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: General contribution guidelines
- **README.md**: Updated with translation information

## Technical Details

### Translation File Structure

The translation files use nested JSON structure:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "step": {
      "user": {
        "title": "Aquarium AI Setup",
        "data": {
          "tank_name": "Aquarium Name"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation

Translation files are validated for:
- Valid JSON syntax
- Matching structure with English version
- All required keys present
- No extra/missing keys

### Testing

To test a translation:
1. Copy translation file to Home Assistant's custom_components directory
2. Change user profile language to match
3. Set up or reconfigure the integration
4. Verify all text appears correctly

## Benefits

### For Users
- Native language interface
- Better understanding of configuration options
- More accessible to non-English speakers
- Professional user experience

### For Contributors
- Easy to contribute (no coding required)
- Clear guidelines and templates
- Fast review and merge process
- Direct impact on user experience

### For the Project
- Broader user base
- Community engagement
- International adoption
- Better accessibility

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. **More Languages**: Community can add Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, etc.

2. **Regional Variants**: 
   - pt-BR (Brazilian Portuguese) vs pt (European Portuguese)
   - zh-CN (Simplified Chinese) vs zh-TW (Traditional Chinese)

3. **Notification Translations**: Currently notifications use English text from AI analysis. Future enhancement could translate standard notification text.

4. **Dynamic Translation**: AI responses are in the AI's language. Could add translation service integration for AI responses.

## Compatibility

- **Home Assistant Version**: Works with all versions supporting custom integrations
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing installations continue to work with English
- **No Breaking Changes**: strings.json retained for compatibility

## Maintenance

### Adding New Strings

When adding new strings to the integration:

1. Add to `strings.json` (default English)
2. Add to `translations/en.json`
3. Add to `translations/template.json`
4. Update existing language files (de.json, etc.)
5. Document in TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md if needed

### Updating Translations

When updating existing strings:

1. Update in `strings.json`
2. Update in all `translations/*.json` files
3. Open issues for community translators to review
4. Update version number in manifest.json

## Known Limitations

1. **AI Analysis Content**: The AI-generated analysis text is in whatever language the AI provider responds with (usually English). This is intentional as the AI provides contextual analysis.

2. **Sensor Names**: Sensor entity names are not translated (they're user-defined in Home Assistant).

3. **Device Names**: Device info uses English "Aquarium AI" but could be localized if needed.

## Statistics

- **Total Translatable Strings**: 62 keys
- **Current Languages**: 2 (English, German)
- **Translation Coverage**: 100%
- **Documentation Pages**: 3 (Translation Guide, Contributing, Implementation)

## Credits

- German translation: Community contribution
- Implementation: Following Home Assistant standards
- Testing: Validated with hassfest and JSON validators
